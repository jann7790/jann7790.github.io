<h2>Hi!</h2> 

I completed <strong>BSc Telecommunications</strong> from [University of Alicante](https://www.ua.es/en) and <strong>MSc Acoustics</strong> from [Polytechnic University of Valencia](http://www.upv.es/en). 

I've worked as a researcher at the <a href="http://igic.webs.upv.es/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=22">IGIC</a> (Waves in complex media group) carrying out a project for the European Space Agency (<a href="https://www.esa.int/">ESA</a>) to <strong>reduce noise on the VEGA rocket launch pad</strong>. I have also been researching at <a href="https://www.i3m-detectors.i3m.upv.es/research/ultrasound-medical-and-industrial-laboratory-umil/">i3M/UMIL</a> (Ultrasound Medical and Industrial Laboratory) in the area of <strong>acoustic metamaterials</strong> and <strong>ultrasound</strong>. You can see my publications [here](/publications/).

My <strong>current interests</strong> are engineering in its broadest sense of the word and research and development in any engineering area. <strong>I love learning new disciplines</strong> and being able to contribute with my knowledge from other areas.

Before working in reasearch I was working as a sound technician for about 6 years. The knowledge acquired in installing, repairing and adjusting systems has facilitated the <strong>development of the experimental systems</strong> that I have needed (and will need) in my research.

Also I like to <strong>develop tools</strong> and applications to perform tasks more easily, I always try to make all my work public so that other people can take advantage of it and improve it (I am sure it can be improved). Visit my profile on [Github](https://github.com/jmrplens). Obviously I'm not a professional developer but I try.

In my spare time, I like cycling (MTB/enduro), hiking with friends and, why deny it, occasionally going out to party and rock concerts.
